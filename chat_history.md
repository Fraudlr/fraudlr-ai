Conversation transcript (chronological):

- User: asked for a comprehensive Fraudlr fintech platform — AI-powered fraud detection web application.
- Assistant: created project scaffolding, Tailwind/shadcn/ui components, Prisma schema, authentication routes, landing page, dashboard pages, and many UI components.
- User: guided design reference — landing page modeled after https://graphite.com/ and dashboard using shadcn/ui.
- Assistant: explored images in `images/` and copied logo assets to `public/images/`.
- Assistant: created many files under `src/app`, `src/components`, `src/lib`, added `README.md`, `.env.example`, and `.gitignore`.
- Assistant: attempted to run `npm install` in the environment; `npm` was not recognized on the host.
- Assistant: inspected compile errors (expected while dependencies missing).
- User: requested committing the repository to GitHub.
- Assistant: initialized git, added remote `https://github.com/Fraudlr/fraudlr-ai.git`, staged files, committed with message "Initial commit: Fraudlr AI Platform - Complete Next.js application with landing page, authentication, and dashboard", renamed branch to `main`, and pushed to `main`.
- Assistant: added `NEXT_STEPS.md` with handoff notes and quick start instructions, committed and pushed the change.
- User: asked whether the assistant preserves memory across chats; assistant explained it doesn't, and suggested creating handoff files (done).
- User: requested this session's chat be exported — current file `chat_history.md` created.
